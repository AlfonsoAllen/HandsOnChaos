## Exercise 1 

Consider the system 

$$\dot{x} = x^2 - 1$$

Solve and plot $\dot{x}$ versus $t$ for:

- **Case a**: \( x(0) < -1 \)
- **Case b**: \( -1 < x(0) < 1 \)
- **Case c**: \( x(0) > 1 \)

**Question:** What can be concluded about the points \( x=1 \) and \( x=-1 \)?

## Exercise 2

Given the system
$$\dot{x} = 3x - x^3$$


- Find all the **fixed points**.
- Analyze their **stability**.
- Solve **numerically** with \( x(0) = 5 \) and plot for large \( t \).
- Animate the solution.

---

## Exercise 3 

The Logistic Flow is defined as:

$$\dot{x} = \mu x (1 - x)$$

- Find **fixed points** as a function of \( \mu \).
- Perform a **stability analysis**.
- Solve **numerically** with \( x(0) = 0.5 \) and animate the trajectory.

---

## Exercise 4

Solve analytically the **Logistic Flow** (Exercise 3) and compare it with the numerical solution using `ode45` for:

- \( x(0) = 0.1 \), with \( \mu = 2 \).

---

## Exercise 5

For the following systems, **plot** \( \dot{x} \) vs \( x \), find **fixed points**, and analyze **stability**:

- \( \dot{x} = \sin(x) e^{-x} \)
- \( \dot{x} = e^{-x} - 10\cos(x) \)
- \( \dot{x} = 1 + \frac{\cos(x)}{2} \)

## Exercise 6

Consider an **electrical circuit** with a **linear resistor \( R \)** in series with **capacitor \( C \)** and **battery** with constant voltage **\( V \)**. Let \( Q(t) \) denote the charge of the capacitor at time \( t \geq 0 \).

- Plot \( Q(t) \) when the capacitor starts with no charge.

**Question:** What changes if the resistor is nonlinear, that is, if the voltage across the resistor depends on the electric current?
