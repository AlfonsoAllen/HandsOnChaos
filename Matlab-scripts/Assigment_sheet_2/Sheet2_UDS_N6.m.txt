% (Strogatz Example 2.2.2) Consider the electrical circuit composed by a 
% linear resistor R in series with a capacitor C and a battery of constant 
%voltage V. Let Q(t) denote the charge of the capacitor at time t>=0. 
% If the capacitor does not have any charge initially, graph Q(t). What if 
% the linear resistor is replaced by a non-linear one in which the voltage 
%across the resistor is a function of the electric current?.
%
% The equation meet by the capacitor charge is dQ/dt=V/R-Q/RC. We solve
% analytically first
% integral(dQ/(V/R-Q/RC)=t, -RClog(V/R-Q/RC)+Konstant=t, and Q(t=0)=0,
% Thus, Konstant=-CRlog/V/R). After some algebra we get
% Q(t)=VC(1-exp(-t/RC)) and I=V/R*exp(-t/RC)
V=1;
R=1;
C=1;
t=linspace(0,5,20);
Q=V*C*(1-exp(-t/R/C));
